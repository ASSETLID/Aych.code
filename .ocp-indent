# This is an example configuration file for ocp-indent
#
# Copy to the root of your project with name ".ocp-indent", customise, and
# transparently get consistent indentation on all your ocaml source files.

# Starting the configuration file with a preset ensures you won't fallback to
# definitions from "~/.ocp/ocp-indent.conf".
# These are `normal`, `apprentice` and `JaneStreet` and set different defaults.
normal

# Number of spaces used in all base cases, for example:
#    let foo =
#    ^^bar
base = 2

# Indent for type definitions:
#    type t =
#    ^^int
type = 2

# Indent after `let in` (unless followed by another `let`):
#    let foo = () in
#    ^^bar
in = 0

# Indent after `match/try with` or `function`:
#    match foo with
#    ^^| _ -> bar
with = 0

# Wether the `with` parameter should be applied even when in a sub-block.
# Can be `always`, `never` or `auto`.
# if `always`, there are no exceptions
# if `auto`, the `with` parameter is superseded when seen fit (most of the time,
#            but not after `begin match` for example)
# if `never`, `with` is only applied if the match block starts a line.
#
# For example, the following is not indented if set to `always`:
#    let f = function
#    ^^| Foo -> bar
strict_with = never

# Indent for clauses inside a pattern-match (after the arrow):
#    match foo with
#    | _ ->
#    ^^^^bar
# the default is 2, which aligns the pattern and the expression
match_clause = 4 # this is non-default

# Ocp-indent will normally try to preserve your in-comment indentation, as long
# as it respects the left-margin or starts with `(*\n`. Setting this to `true`
# forces alignment within comments.
strict_comments = false

# Function parameters are normally indented one level from the line containing
# the function. This option can be used to have them align relative to the
# column of the function body instead.
# if set to `always`, always align below the function
# if `auto`, only do that when seen fit (mainly, after arrows)
# if `never`, no alignment whatsoever
#
# for example (left: `never`; right: `always or `auto)
#    match foo with         #    match foo with
#    | _ -> some_fun        #    | _ -> some_fun
#      ^^parameter          #           ^^parameter
align_params = auto

# When nesting expressions on the same line, their indentation are in
# some cases stacked, so that it remains correct if you close them one
# at a line. This may lead to large indents in complex code though, so
# this parameter can be used to set a maximum value.
#
# for example (left: `none`; right: `4`)
#    let f = g (h (i (fun x ->     #    let f = g (h (i (fun x ->
#          x)                      #        x)
#        )                         #      )
#      )                           #    )
